Intersection with web3 and cryptography: 

We highly encourage you to build solutions at the intersection. During the residency you can learn more about these concepts from experts and form teams with people with web3 and cryptography background. 

Decentralized frameworks in web3 could be used for securely sharing and managing sensitive multi-omics and clinical data. Cryptographic techniques, such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and ZKPs, can enable privacy-preserving analytics, allowing researchers to collaborate across institutions without exposing raw data. Blockchain-based funding platforms and DAOs can allocate resources equitably to longevity research projects, governed transparently by stakeholder consensus.
